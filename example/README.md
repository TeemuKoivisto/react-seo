# Simple Gatsby Site

I've used my own blog site's code as the basis of the app. Yes it's quite contrived but sadly this is quite necessary when you start customizing the Gatsby setup heavily. It's supposed to be a minimal setup to show the react-seo-meta-tags work.

## Requirements

Requires Node >= 8.

## How to install

1) Clone & run `npm i`
2) Start the Gatsby development server with: `npm start`
