Hello there!

You should pay close attention to the dimensions of your image, the 1.91:1 ratio is no joke and you should follow it. Otherwise images such as this get cropped weirdly.

Funny thing also that .png images don't work with gatsby-plugin-sharp. I have no idea but they just don't.

This blog is awesome.
